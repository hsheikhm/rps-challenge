Task
----

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked you to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Hints on functionality:

- The marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- The marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- The marketeer can choose one option
- The game will choose a random option
- A winner will be declared



## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock
